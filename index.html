                <p>
                    Hello! This is my portfolio website. This website was built as the
                    first homework assignment for the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at
                    University of Richmond. As the course continues, I will be coming
                    back to this website to update with my progress. I am looking to
                    become a full stack specialist.
                    <br>
                    You can find out more about me, or reach out to me at the
                    following
                    <li><a href="mailto:aosilvester@gmail.com">aosilvester@gmail.com</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aosilvester/">LinkedIn</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/aosilvester">GitHub</a></ul>

                        <br><br>
                        In my free time, I am a musician. I know the Trombone, Tuba and
                        Baritone. I am currently learning how to play the ukulele. In my
                        time in college, I was a member of the university marching band.
                        It
                        afforded me the opportunity to travel across the country and see
                        places I would never have the chance to otherwise. I made
                        lifetime friends, and look back fondly on my time there. I try to
                        go back
                        at least once a year.
                        <br><br>
                        In an attempt to be healthy and nutritious, I have been learning
                        to cook. If you ask my wife I cook eggs the best. I love outdoor
                        cooking so much, I have two grills and a smoker. If I had more
                        time, I
                        would barbecue every day.
                        <br><br>
