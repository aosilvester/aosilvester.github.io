        Hello! I am an up and coming full-stack web developer trying to get my career started. I am going through a certification program at University of Richmond. It is rigorous, and it takes up so much of my time, but it is not all there is to know about me. 
<br><br>
        What else is there to know about me? What a great question! I have been a musician for the last 18 years of my life! I love to cook! I own two grills and a smoker. If I had all the time in the world, I would spend it learning how to cook every dish and play every musical instrument.
<br><br>
        Another important part of my life is getting in shape. I have lost 20 pounds in the last 12 months, and I don't plan on stopping there. My goal is to be able to do pull ups with ease.
